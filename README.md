🩺 AI-Based Healthcare Symptom Checker (ICD Prediction)

An AI-powered backend service that analyzes user-reported symptoms and predicts possible medical conditions using ICD codes. The system uses Google Gemini (LLM) for symptom understanding and medical inference, exposed through a Flask REST API.

⚠️ This project is for educational purposes only and is not a medical diagnostic tool.

🚀 Features

🧠 AI-powered symptom understanding using Google Gemini

🏥 Predicts possible medical conditions (ICD-based)

🌐 REST API built with Flask

🔄 CORS enabled for frontend integration

📦 Modular backend structure

🧪 Easy to test with Postman / frontend apps

The model used in this has been depricated. The team is the process to fix it.
